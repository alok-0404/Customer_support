# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide - SSL Setup

## Step 1: Copy Script to EC2

```bash
# From your local machine
scp -i your-key.pem setup-ssl.sh ec2-user@44.221.30.127:~/
```

## Step 2: SSH into EC2

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@44.221.30.127
```

## Step 3: Run Script

```bash
chmod +x setup-ssl.sh
./setup-ssl.sh
```

## What Script Does:

âœ… Updates system packages
âœ… Installs Nginx
âœ… Installs Certbot (SSL certificate tool)
âœ… Configures firewall
âœ… Gets SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
âœ… Sets up Nginx as reverse proxy
âœ… Configures HTTPS for your domain
âœ… Restarts services

## After Script Completes:

1. âœ… Backend will be accessible at: `https://mydiamond99clientsupport.in`
2. âœ… No more SSL errors
3. âœ… Mobile browser will work properly

## Troubleshooting:

### If script fails:
```bash
# Check logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

# Test Nginx config
sudo nginx -t

# Check if Nginx is running
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

### If domain is not verified:
Make sure DNS A record points to: `44.221.30.127`

## Manual Steps (If Script Fails):

See `SSL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed manual steps.

**That's it!** After running the script, your backend will have HTTPS support. ðŸŽ‰
